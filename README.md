I'm Umang Malhotra, currently pursuing a PG Program in Data Science and Generative AI with a specialization in Data Analytics from IIIT Bangalore. Iâ€™m passionate about uncovering insights from data and transforming them into actionable business strategies.

My journey so far has equipped me with strong hands-on skills in:
- Python: Data Structures, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SQL: CTEs, Views, Nested Queries, Window Functions, Stored Procedures
- EDA: Data cleaning, outlier/null handling, and univariate to multivariate analysis
- Data Viz: Tableau, Power BI, Excel
- Storytelling and dashboard building to drive informed decision-making

With a solid background in automotive embedded software development, I bring an engineering mindset, collaborative spirit, and a strong emphasis on clear communication and professional transparency. I'm now focused on transitioning into the data analytics domain, where I can leverage my technical foundation and analytical thinking to solve real-world problems.
